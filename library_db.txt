4. Add the book 'The Pragmatic Programmer', and add yourself as a member. Check out 'The Pragmatic Programmer'.
Use your query from question 1 to verify that you have checked it out. Also, provide the SQL used to update the database.

    INSERT INTO book VALUES(11, "The Pragmatic Programmer");

    INSERT INTO member VALUES(43, "Stivali Serna");

    INSERT INTO checkout_item(member_id, book_id) VALUES(
    (SELECT member.id
    FROM member
